# Ad-MobileNet

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) continue to dominate research in the area of hardware acceleration using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA), proving its effectiveness in a variety of computer vision applications such as object segmentation, image classification, face detection, and traffic signs recognition, among others. However, there are numerous constraints for deploying CNNs on FPGA, including limited on-chip memory, CNN size, and configuration parameters. This paper introduces Ad-MobileNet, an advanced CNN model inspired by the baseline MobileNet model. The proposed model uses an Ad-depth engine, which is an improved version of the depth-wise separable convolution unit. Moreover, we propose an FPGA-based implementation model that supports the Mish, TanhExp, and ReLU activation functions. The experimental results using the CIFAR-10 dataset show that our Ad-MobileNet has a classification accuracy of 88.76% while requiring little computational hardware resources. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our proposed method has a fairly high recognition rate while using fewer computational hardware resources. Indeed, the proposed model helps to reduce hardware resources by more than 41% compared to that of the baseline model.
